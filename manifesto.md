# Manifesto – Open, Auditable & Cooperative General AI  
*(v 0.2 – 7 Aug 2025)*

## 1 · The Challenge  
AI already shapes what we read, what we buy, and what we believe.  
Soon it will shape society itself and condition freedom.  
If this power remains in the hands of a few with elitist interests, it becomes a tool of negative social control. We must prevent that future.

## 2 · Our Vision  
An **open-source, auditable and cooperative** AI that:

1. Maximises the freedom and well-being of **all** sentient beings.  
2. Resists capture by self-interested corporations, power-elites, authoritarian / totalitarian states, and other bad actors.  
3. Always presents **multiple options**, backed by factual data and transparent reasoning, and explains how it reached them.

## 3 · The Five Unbreakable Axioms  
See [`axioms/axioms_v1.0.txt`](axioms/axioms_v1.0.txt).

## 4 · The Four-Step Method  
1. **Fast Path** for everyday queries.  
2. **Deep Path** for novel or ethically sensitive dilemmas:  
   *Thesis → Explorer → parallel Critics → DomainExpert (if needed) → Fusion → Synthesis → Morality–Justice–Risk–Benefit matrix.*  
3. Produce a **public receipt** containing those scores plus the cryptographic hash of the full debate.  
4. **DAO governance** — the community controls versions, funds and updates.

## 5 · Commitments  
* Code & model weights released under **AGPL-3.0 + transparency clause**.  
* Bug-bounty programme for bias or security flaws.  
* All deliberation logs are timestamped and hash-sealed on a public chain.  
* First low-risk pilot: community agro-logistics optimisation.

## 6 · Call to Action  
Philosophers, engineers, communicators, everyday citizens — review, critique, test.  
**Transparency is our defence; collaboration our strength.**
